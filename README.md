> Remove terrible news from your Twitter Moments page to prevent ruining your day!

Have you ever gone on Twitter to look at funny or informative content - only to stumble upon Twitter's Moment page and receive news related to terrible events happening around the world that you wish you never saw?

Currently, there is no way to block or mute Twitter moments and moments aren't customized based on your personal interest.

This chrome extension will allow the user to replace negative content from the Twitter Moments page based on a document sentiment score processed by Google's Cloud Natural Language API.

## Planned Tech Stack:

---

- Javascript
- Google Cloud - Cloud Natural Language API

### Planned Features:

---

- Use Google Cloud's API to process Twitter Moment's title
- Replace content with Unsplash photos
